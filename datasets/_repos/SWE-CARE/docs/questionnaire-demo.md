### Context

#### Problem Statement

> Specify Columns to update on incremental Models
> ### Describe the feature
> Allow model developer the ability to choose the set of columns that require updating on incremental loads
> 
> ### Who will this benefit?
> This will benefit all users that are performing an incremental update of a wide table with few columns that are mutable

#### Hints (pre-PR comments or linked issues context)

> hey @richmintz! Can you say more about this? I think it's a good idea - I'm curious if you're interested in this feature for performance reasons, or something else.
> Hi @drewbanin!
> My primary goal would be performance, minimizing writes and index rebuilds. However I also think it will generate more concise sql for large tables when a merge is required. 
> Got it! Sure, this makes a lot of sense in `merge` statements. Is this on Snowflake/BigQuery? I think a similar paradigm would apply to Redshift/Postgres, but we'd modify the `update` statement instead of the `merge` statement.
> 
> I can imagine a config like `update_columns` which could be supplied like:
> ```
> {{
>   config(
>     materialized='incremental',
>     update_columns=['order_total', 'count_orders']
>   )
> }}
> ```
> 
> If `update_columns` is not provided, or if it is `null`, dbt will default to updating all of the columns in the model.
> 
> You buy all of that?
>  
> 
> As part of this proposed change, it would also be nice to be able to exclude the `when matched then update set` part of the merge altogether, as in some of my models I'm only interested in adding new rows since the source data is never updated (for event-based data for example or other append-only tables), and it makes the model execution faster (at least in BigQuery).
> 
> It could be a separate config `no_update = True` or just a convention that doesn't include the SQL block when `update_columns` is empty.
> 
> Please note I tested this and would work for BigQuery, other databases might need a different syntax to support no-op for updates.
> 
> Any thoughts?
> hey @bfil - if you do not supply a `unique_key` for your incremental model's config, then dbt should not inject a `when matched then update set....` clause to the merge statement. 
> 
> Check out the implementation here:
> https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/7a07017b96ac332c872725343833a94b49129c68/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/materializations/common/merge.sql#L23-L48
> @drewbanin I know, but I still want to compare and insert only the new data based on that unique key rather than merging on an always `FALSE` condition. Makes sense?
> ah! Sure, that makes a lot of sense. What do you think about pushing this code down from the materialization layer and into the modeling layer. Could you do something like:
> 
> ```
> {{ config(materialized='incremental') }}
> 
> select id, col1, col2 from {{ ref('some_table') }}
> {% if is_incremental() %}
> where id not in (select id from {{ this }})
> {% endif %}
> ```
> 
> This is a kind of funny adaptation of the [typical incremental modeling approach](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-incremental-models), but it should serve to only select the _new_ records from your source table, inserting them directly into the destination table.
> @drewbanin : any update on where we are with this feature...i have a wide table [Snowflake] but i only need to update very few columns in the incremental model. any ETA's on the feature ?
> hey @ee07dazn - no movement on this issue on our end to report. I think the spec I mentioned above (pasted below) is still a good idea:
> 
> ```
> {{
>   config(
>     materialized='incremental',
>     update_columns=['order_total', 'count_orders']
>   )
> }
> ```
> 
> I think that this feature should only be supported on databases that support `merge` statements, as dbt's delete+insert approach doesn't really lend itself well to this approach. If anyone is interested in working on this one, I'd be happy to try to point you in the right direction. 
> 
> The key change here will be to replace the call to [`adapter.get_columns_in_relation`](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/f3565f3f70062c5818395d03a52c89e87616f956/plugins/snowflake/dbt/include/snowflake/macros/materializations/incremental.sql#L59) with `config.get('update_columns')`. We'll want to implement this for both the Snowflake and BigQuery incremental materializations when the `merge` strategy is used.
> Thanks @drewbanin for the information and a pointer. Apart from what you had suggested, i had to make change to the default__get_merge_sql macro to make that approach work. It works now but i am just not happy to make a change to something as low level as default__get_merge_sql. Probably i think i can update the snowflake_get_merge_sql to do this job. Thinking out loud...but thanks for the help.
